# CANVAS
**CANVAS: CANOPUS and SIRIUS Visualization & Analysis System**

## Overview
CANVAS is an interactive Dash application for **visualization and interpretation of LC-MS metabolomics data** integrated with [MSDIAL](https://systemsomicslab.github.io/compms/msdial/main.html) and processed with the [SIRIUS](https://bio.informatik.uni-jena.de/software/sirius/) workflow, including compound classification results from **CANOPUS**.  

The tool enables researchers to:
- Integrate SIRIUS and CANOPUS outputs with intensity-based measurements.
- Explore metabolite classes dynamically using thresholds and ontology levels.
- Visualize results with **sunburst plots, bar charts, PCA and random forest classifier**.
- Compare metabolite distributions across samples or conditions.
- Streamline hypothesis generation in untargeted metabolomics workflows.

## Features
- üìä **Interactive visualizations** (sunburst, bar charts, PCA, random forest).  
- üß≠ **Dynamic filtering** by class confidence and Sirius annotation scores, by hierarchy levels and intensity levels.  
- üîç **Exploration of SIRIUS & CANOPUS outputs** with user-friendly controls.  
- üß™ **Example datasets** provided (plant, lipidomics, human cell metabolomics).
